Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a discipline concerned with the systematic development of high quality software products using engineering products, methods and tools.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the rise of agile methodologies
development of languages such as Fortran and C
the advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement - this is the stage of the life cycle where we gather user needs and docoument them
design - we design the software architecture and user interface here
implementation - this where we code our design
testing - here we carry out tests on various parts of  our software
deployment - here we make it public for users to use
maintenance - support to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is linear in its approach. it also relies heavily on documentation.
Agile methodology offers continuous testing through out the project. It is iterative in its approach.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer builds the software  using programming languages, the quality assurance engineer ensures the software meets user requirements and then the project manager oversees the flow of the project for its duration.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environment provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code. example is VS code. Version control system is for tracking changes to source code and for collaboration among team mates.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines - it is best practice to ask a developer how long it would take for him to deliver on his own end than to tie him down to a time limit
Changing requirements -  if the method used was waterfall then this would cost the project time and money as waterfall isn't as iterative as agile.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- testing an individual part of a software.
integration test - testing a part of a software to see how it interacts with another part.
system testing -is testing the entire software
acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is knowing how to prompt an AI model, it is important because better prompts helps the AI model deliver better responses and it hitherto trains the AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - what car should  i get 
improved prompt - I want to get a car that has minimal fuel consumption and its spare parts can be easily sourced in africa. also it has top speed of 370km/h. This prompt is effective cos i provided more details to help the model
